Write out a generic SELECT statement.
- SELECT name, age
    FROM class
    WHERE age < 15;

Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.
-S (SELECT): San
F (FROM): Francisco
W (WHERE): Work
L (LIKE):  Life

Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:
Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
-SELECT name,gender,age
 FROM dogs
 WHERE breed LIKE 'labrador%';

Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
-SELECT id
 FROM dogs
 WHERE dogs < 1 yr old;

Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
-SELECT name, age
 FROM dogs
 WHERE gender = 'female' AND weight > 35;

Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
-SELECT *
 FROM dogs
 WHERE breed
 NOT LIKE ''%Shepherd';

Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
-SELECT id, age, weight, breed
 FROM dogs
 WHERE weight > 60 OR breed = 'great danes';

Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
SELECT name, age FROM cats;

Name            Adoption Date
Mushi            2016-03-22
Seashell            null
Azul             2016-04-17
Victoire         2016-09-01
Nala                null

Name                Age
Mushi                1
Seashell             7
Azul                 3
Victoire             7
Nala                 1

From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
Display all the information about all of the available cats.
Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
-SELECT * FROM cats WHERE adoption_date IS NOT NULL;
SELECT name, gender FROM cats WHERE age = 7;
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cats;

List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!
-
<  : Comparing 2 values, when value A is greater than value B (B < A)
> : Comparing 2 values, when value A is less than value B (B > A)
<= : Comparing 2 values, when value A is greater or equal to value B (B <= A)
>= : Comparing 2 values, when value A is less or equal to value B (B >= A)
= : When 2 values are equal (A = B)
!= : When 2 values are not equal (A != B )
<> : When 2 values are not equal  (A <> B)
AND : Both expressions have to be true in order for the row to be returned
OR : Either one of the expression has to be true in order for the row to be returned
NOT : The expression has to be false for the row to be returned
